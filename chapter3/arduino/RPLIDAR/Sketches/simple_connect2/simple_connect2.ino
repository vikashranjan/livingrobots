 * RoboPeak RPLIDAR Arduino Example
 * This example shows the easy and common way to fetch data from an RPLIDAR
 * 
 * You may freely add your application code based on this template
 *
 * USAGE:
 * ---------------------------------
 * 1. Download this sketch code to your Arduino board
 * 2. Connect the RPLIDAR's serial port (RX/TX/GND) to your Arduino board (Pin 0 and Pin1)
 * 3. Connect the RPLIDAR's motor ctrl pin to the Arduino board pin 3
